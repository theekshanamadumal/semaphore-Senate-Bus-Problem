# semaphore-Senate-Bus-Problem
“Little book of Semaphores”, page 211

This problem was originally based on the Senate bus at Wellesley College. Riders come to a bus
stop and wait for a bus. When the bus arrives, all the waiting riders invoke boardBus, but anyone who
arrives while the bus is boarding has to wait for the next bus. The capacity of the bus is 50 people; if there
are more than 50 people waiting, some will have to wait for the next bus. When all the waiting riders have
boarded, the bus can invoke depart. If the bus arrives when there are no riders, it should depart
immediately

program with appropriate synchronization code that enforces all of these constraints in
java.


Notes

• This problem is taken from the book “Little book of Semaphores”, page 211. It is ok to look at
the solution. But if you have the same answer and you cannot explain how it works, you will not
get any marks (randomly selected set of students will be invited for a one-on-one grading session).

• The reason for forcing you to use Java is that implementing synchronization code in Java is
relatively easier than several other languages

• Note that busses and riders will continue to arrive throughout the day. Assume inter-arrival time
of busses and riders are exponentially distributed with a mean of 20 min and 30 sec, respectively.

• Each lab group consists of up to 2 students. You are free to select your lab buddy.

• Students are encouraged to talk to the lecturer and instructors for any clarifications. Discussions
on Moodle are encouraged too
